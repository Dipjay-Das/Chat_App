Here's a structured explanation of my project approach along with assumptions made during the assignment:

Project Approach:

Initial Setup:
Installed necessary dependencies like React Icons for icon usage.
Structured icons using HTML and CSS, applying hover effects for interactive UI.

Search Bar Implementation:
Created a search bar component with an input field and a search icon using React Icons.
Implemented search functionality to dynamically filter results based on username or ID number.
Displayed relevant search results in real-time as the user types or presses the Enter key.
Incorporated a toggle switch to switch between two modes: User-related search and chat, and Document repository-related search and chat.

Chat Container:
Designed a chat container displaying the username and text.
Added an input field for sending messages, along with send and voice functionality.
Applied hover effects on usernames and research topics for enhanced interactivity.

Toggle Switch for Mode Selection:
Implemented a toggle switch to switch between Mode 1 and Mode 2, altering the UI as per the design specifications.
Mode 1: User-related search and chat.
Mode 2: Document repository-related search and chat.

Chevron Icon for Menu Collapse:
Utilized a chevron icon to collapse the menu, ensuring a clean and organized UI.

State Management:
Used useState to manage the state of components, particularly for handling search functionality and mode toggling.


Assumptions Made:

Search Functionality:
Assumed that the search functionality would primarily filter results based on either username or ID number.
Assumed that search results would be displayed instantly as the user types, without the need for a separate search button.

Mode Switching:
Assumed that Mode 1 and Mode 2 would have distinct UI designs and functionalities, as specified in the designs provided.
Assumed that the toggle switch would smoothly transition between modes without any additional user input.

Chat Interface:
Assumed that the chat interface would include standard features such as message sending and user identification.
Assumed that hover effects on usernames and research topics would provide additional context or actions upon interaction.

Styling and UI/UX:
Assumed that the overall styling and layout of the application would follow design specifications provided by the recruiter or project guidelines.
Assumed that hover effects and interactive elements would enhance the user experience and usability of the application.
